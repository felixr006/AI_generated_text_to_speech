# AI_generated_text_to_speech
this is a model where we can generate speech audio by giving the input text.


Well hello again, nowadays we do not feel confident with our own words while we edit video or give a voiceover to any video. So here is a simple model which generates speech on the text input

The library we have used :
1. transformers sentencepiece datasets[audio]
2. pip
3. soundfile
4. torch
5. datasets

step 1: install manually the libraries

step 2: Run the simple code

When the code runs and asks for a prompt enter the text you want to generate as a speech. You will find the file in the file's runtime section.
